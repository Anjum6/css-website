                Welcome to The Little Kitchen! My name is Jeanine, and I created The Little Kitchen to celebrate how nourishing,
                fun, and delicious cooking with seasonal fruits and vegetables can be. I hope that the recipes here inspire
                you to try cooking a new vegetable, or try cooking a familiar vegetable in a new way. You'll find a host of
                inventive vegetarian recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but I also want The Little Kitchen to be a resource
                for you. We have guides to working with vegetables ranging from spaghetti squash to asparagus and tips for cooking
                plant-based basics like quinoa, rice, and lentils. And after all those veggies, I always save room for dessert! 
                In my opinion, healthy eating is all about balance.
                <br><br>
                I live in Chicago, and in the summertime, we have fantastic local farmers markets and CSA options here.
                My favorites are the Lincoln Park and Logan Square markets. But because of Chicago's cold climate, these markets 
                aren't open year-round. In the winter, I shop at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Marianos, or Jewel.
